# Roll-a-Ball Extended

This is a personal project created based off of the Unity Tutorial series Roll a ball found here: [link](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial)

As I learn more about the features available in Unity or am otherwise inspired, I'll be adding new features to the game hopefully with some documentation

Added Features list:
1. Sine wave bobbing for pickup items (see [Rotator](https://github.com/ajinomoto124/Roll-a-Ball_Extended/blob/master/Roll%20a%20Ball/Assets/Scripts/Rotator.cs) script)
2. A simple timer (see [Timer](https://github.com/ajinomoto124/Roll-a-Ball_Extended/blob/master/Roll%20a%20Ball/Assets/Scripts/Timer.cs) Script)
3. Spawnable enemies that chase the player with a SmoothDamped speed (see [EnemyScript](https://github.com/ajinomoto124/Roll-a-Ball_Extended/blob/master/Roll%20a%20Ball/Assets/Scripts/EnemyScript.cs))
4. Restartable rounds in case player is killed by an enemy
