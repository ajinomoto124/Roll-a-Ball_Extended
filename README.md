# Roll-a-Ball Extended

This is a personal project created based off of the Unity Tutorial series Roll a ball found here: [link](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial)

As I learn more about the features available in Unity or am otherwise inspired, I'll be adding new features to the game hopefully with some documentation

Added Features list:
1. Sine wave bobbing for pickup items (see Rotator script)
2. A simple timer
3. Spawnable enemies that chase the player with a SmoothDamped speed (see EnemyScript)
4. Restartable rounds in case player is killed by an enemy
